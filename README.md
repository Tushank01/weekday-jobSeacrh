Job Search App
Overview
This is a simple React-based web application for searching job listings based on various criteria such as role, experience, location, and salary. Users can filter job listings using dropdown menus and search for specific job titles. The app fetches job data from an external API and dynamically updates the UI based on user selections.

Features
Filtering: Users can filter job listings based on role, experience, location, salary, and currency code.
Search: Users can search for specific job titles using the search bar.
Dynamic UI: The app dynamically updates the job listings based on user selections and search queries.
Responsive Design: The UI is responsive and works well on different screen sizes.
Technologies Used
React: The frontend is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
API Integration: The app fetches job data from an external API using asynchronous JavaScript (async/await).
CSS: Custom CSS styles are applied for styling the components and layout.
